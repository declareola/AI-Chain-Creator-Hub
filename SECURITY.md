# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures and best practices for AI-Chain-Creator-Hub.

## Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Zero Trust**: Verify all access requests
- **Fail Safe**: Default to secure state on errors

## Smart Contract Security

### Development Practices
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts and libraries
- Implement comprehensive test coverage (100% for critical functions)
- Conduct formal verification where possible
- Follow Checks Effects Interactions pattern

### Audit Requirements
- Third-party security audit mandatory before mainnet deployment
- Bug bounty program post-launch
- Ongoing security monitoring

### Upgradeable Contracts
- UUPS proxy pattern for upgradeability
- Timelock for critical changes
- Multi-signature governance for upgrades

## Backend Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Secure session management
- Regular security updates

### API Security
- CORS configuration
- Helmet.js for security headers
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Frontend Security

### Client-Side Security
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Subresource Integrity (SRI)
- Secure cookie settings
- Input validation

### Wallet Integration
- Verify contract addresses
- Warn users of transaction risks
- Implement transaction simulation
- Secure private key handling

## Infrastructure Security

### Cloud Security
- Use managed services with security features
- Implement network segmentation
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Automated security patching

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time security monitoring
- Automated alerting for suspicious activities
- Log analysis and correlation
- Incident response procedures

## Key Management

### Private Keys
- Use hardware security modules (HSM)
- Implement key rotation policies
- Secure backup procedures
- Access logging and monitoring

### Secrets Management
- Use dedicated secret management service (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Never store secrets in code
- Regular rotation of secrets
- Least privilege access

## Compliance & Regulations

- Affected user communication
- Regulatory reporting
- Remediation measures

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing
- Code reviews
- Red team exercises
- Social engineering assessments

## Third-Party Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability monitoring
- License compliance checking
- Supply chain security
