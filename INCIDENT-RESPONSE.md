## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection & Assessment (0-15 minutes)
1. Incident detected via monitoring/alerts
2. Initial assessment of impact and scope
3. Incident classification and team notification
4. Incident Commander appointed

### Phase 2: Containment (15-60 minutes)
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Implement temporary fixes
3. Preserve evidence for investigation
4. Notify relevant stakeholders

### Phase 3: Eradication (1-4 hours)
1. Identify root cause
2. Remove malicious elements
3. Patch vulnerabilities
4. Test fixes in isolated environment

### Phase 4: Recovery (4-24 hours)
1. Restore systems from clean backups
2. Monitor system health
3. Gradual rollout to production
4. User communication

### Phase 5: Lessons Learned (24-72 hours)
1. Post-incident review meeting
2. Document findings and actions
3. Update procedures and tools
4. Report to relevant authorities if required

## Communication Protocols

### Internal Communications
- Use dedicated Slack channel: #incident-response
- Regular updates every 30 minutes during active incidents
- Document all decisions and actions in real-time

### External Communications

- Notify regulators as required by law
- Provide status updates via status page

## Tools & Resources

### Monitoring Tools
- Application: New Relic, DataDog
- Infrastructure: AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring
- Security: SIEM system, IDS/IPS

### Communication Tools
- Primary: Slack
- Backup: Email, SMS
- Status Page: Status.io or similar

### Documentation Tools
- Incident tracking: Jira Service Desk
- Knowledge base: Confluence
- Runbooks: GitHub repository

## Specific Incident Types

### Security Breach
1. Isolate compromised systems
2. Change all credentials
3. Notify affected users
4. Engage forensic experts
5. Report to authorities if required

### Data Loss
1. Assess backup integrity
2. Restore from most recent clean backup
3. Verify data consistency
4. Notify affected users
