# TIP Guide (Test, Integration, Production)

This guide outlines the process for testing, integrating, and deploying the AI-Chain-Creator-Hub platform.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Run unit tests for each package: `npm test`
- Ensure code coverage meets minimum requirements (80%)

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between frontend, backend, and contracts
- Use testnet deployments for integration testing

### End-to-End Tests
- Simulate user workflows from creation to marketplace
- Test on Base Sepolia testnet

## Integration Checklist

- [ ] Frontend connects to backend APIs
- [ ] Backend integrates with database
- [ ] Contracts deployed and verified on testnet
- [ ] Wallet connections working
- [ ] AI services integrated

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
- All tests passing
- Security audit completed
- Mainnet contracts deployed
- Environment variables configured

### Deployment Steps
1. Build frontend: `npm run build`
2. Deploy backend to production server
3. Update contract addresses in configuration
4. Run database migrations
5. Configure monitoring and alerts

## Monitoring
- Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Monitor performance metrics
- Track user engagement KPIs

## Rollback Plan
- Maintain previous deployment versions
- Quick rollback scripts available
- Data backup procedures in place
