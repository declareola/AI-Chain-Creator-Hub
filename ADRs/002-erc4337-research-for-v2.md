# ADR 002: ERC-4337 Research for V2

## Status
Proposed

## Context
For V2 of the platform, we want to implement gasless transactions and social logins to improve user experience. ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) could enable this.

## Decision
We will research and plan for ERC-4337 integration in V2, focusing on:

- Gasless transactions for users
- Social login capabilities
- Improved UX for Web3 interactions

## Research Areas
- ERC-4337 specification and implementations
- Compatible wallet providers
- Security implications
- Gas cost analysis

## Timeline
- Research Phase: Complete by end of Q1 2025
- Implementation: V2 release (Q2 2025)

## Consequences
- Positive: Better user onboarding
- Positive: Reduced friction in transactions
- Negative: Additional complexity in smart contracts
- Negative: Potential security risks if not implemented correctly

## Next Steps
- Review ERC-4337 documentation
- Prototype basic implementation
- Assess compatibility with existing contracts
