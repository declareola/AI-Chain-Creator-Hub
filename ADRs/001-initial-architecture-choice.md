# ADR 001: Initial Architecture Choice

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose an architecture for the AI-Chain-Creator-Hub monorepo that supports multiple modules (NFT Creator Hub, Content Marketplace, DeFi Auto Trader) while allowing for future scalability and modularity.

## Decision
We will use a monorepo structure with separate packages for each module, managed via npm workspaces. This allows for:

- Shared dependencies
- Easy cross-package imports
- Independent deployment of modules
- Better code organization

## Consequences
- Positive: Easier to manage shared code and dependencies
- Positive: Supports microservices architecture
- Negative: Larger repository size
- Negative: Potential for tight coupling between packages

## Alternatives Considered
- Separate repositories: More complex to manage shared code
- Single package: Harder to scale and maintain

## Implementation
Use npm workspaces with the following structure:
- packages/frontend
- packages/backend
- packages/contracts
- packages/trader
- packages/scripts
